    ========================
    Project: {project_name}

    For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), feature selection is not a separate,
    explicit step. The model learns relevant features directly from the image pixels
    during the training process.

    - The convolutional layers act as feature extractors.
    - Early layers learn basic features like edges and textures.
    - Deeper layers combine these to learn more complex features like shapes and objects.

    Therefore, this stage is a conceptual placeholder in this DVC pipeline.
